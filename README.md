# build-a-dice-game
My customized version of Scrimba's dice game - my first own small project

The basics were partly already given by Scrimba, or built within the course. I've added / changed the following:

- changed the color scheme
- added a button - you can win the double amount of points or loose the number of points you just scored 
- added a message that displays if you got lucky on that or not
- a trophy for the winner will appear

## Deployment
Deployed via Netlify at: https://60815a088bf0d312aab2a760--goofy-ride-c1fb04.netlify.app/
